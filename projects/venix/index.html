                <h2>Venix: A 4WD Mecanum-Wheeled Robot with Advanced Control</h2>
                <p>
                   Venix is a highly adaptable, 4WD mecanum-wheeled robot designed to push the boundaries of mobile robotics. 
                   With its innovative control algorithms and custom-built chassis, it provides a unique platform that can seamlessly transition from manual control to full autonomy. 
                   Venix is ideal for both educational purposes and practical robotics applications, offering an extensive suite of features with the potential for future upgrades.

                <h3>From Input to Output</h3>
                <p>
                    Venix is heavily off of a Raspberry Pi 0, with it small yet powerful capabilities. The processing begins its journey at a wireless USB joystick with the <code>pygame</code> library, getting and setting x and y axis values.
                    Then, the main processing script gets the axis data and convertes them to motor values via inverse kinematics. It then calculates the appropriate PWM channels for the PCA9685 and sends the values via the <code>busio</code> library (<code>I<sup>2</sup>C</code>).
                    The PCA9685 scales the values and sets PWM. The motor drivers (MDD3A) receives these PWM values and sets all 4 motors accordingly.
